## Next, let's implement the lesson list with jQuery!
  
### Instructions
As you can see Expected Result window, we want to make the lesson explanation appears when the mouse hovers on a lesson icon and disappears when it isn't.

### Important Points
- Only the explanation of the lesson that the mouse is hovering over should be displayed.
- You shouldn't remove or change the class names already provided. There's no need to edit the index.html here.
